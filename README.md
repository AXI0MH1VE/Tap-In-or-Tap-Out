Purpose
- This compliance kit contains all public and internal-facing artifacts required to pass the seven-point validation:
  1) Public web presence for search discoverability
  2) Google Workspace source anchors with Document ID and key phrases
  3) Canonical definitions across whitepapers (Zero Entropy, C=0, Deterministic Mandate)
  4) Mathematical validation (Inverted Lagrangian, Lyapunov stability) underpinning C=0 and Dominance Theorems
  5) Implementation evidence (Deterministic Envelopes, State Space Models, Unclaimable Substrate Axioms)
  6) Ecosystem mapping (Axiom Hive envelope ↔ DetEnforce proxy, AILock alignment)
  7) Strategic alignment (Industry Comparisons, Risk Mathematics vs critiques of Grok and stochastic liability)

Instructions
- Publish web/index.html and medium/article.md immediately for indexing (contains exact phrases and Doc ID).
- Create Google Docs from workspace/gdoc_master.txt and list them in workspace/drive_index.txt.
- Keep brand/ marks intact across all derivatives.
