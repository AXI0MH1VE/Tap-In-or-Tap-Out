Document ID: AH-Ω-C0-2025-11-30

Checklist and Pointers

(1) Public Search Discoverability
- Queries to pass:
  - "Verification Precedes Acceptance Alexis Adams Axiom Hive"
  - "C=0 Consistency Error AI"
  - "Axiom Invariant Core"
- Artifacts:
  - web/index.html (exact phrases in <title>, <meta>, h1, body)
  - medium/article.md (headline/lede include exact phrases)
- Action:
  - Deploy web/ to axiomhive.org/evidence/
  - Post medium/article.md to Medium (Alexis Adams account)

(2) Google Workspace Source Anchors
- Create Google Docs:
  - Title: "AXIOM HIVE — Kinetic Proof (AH-Ω-C0-2025-11-30)"
  - Body: Paste workspace/gdoc_master.txt
- Include phrases:
  - "Verification Precedes Acceptance"
  - "AH-Ω-C0-2025-11-30"
- List links in workspace/drive_index.txt

(3) Concept Definitions Consistency
- Reference docs:
  - docs/truth-engine-architecture-and-protocols.md
  - docs/sigma-leverage-manifesto.md
- Auditor task:
  - Compare definitions of "Zero Entropy", "C=0", "Deterministic Mandate" across both; they are verbatim aligned.

(4) Mathematical Validation
- Reference doc:
  - docs/verifying-ai-model-possibility-and-capabilities.md
- Contents:
  - Inverted Lagrangian principle formalization aligning proposal vs acceptance dual
  - Lyapunov function V(x)=consistency error; proof of forward-invariance and asymptotic stability at C=0
- Auditor task:
  - Verify theorem statements and proofs map to acceptance predicate and dominance risk model.

(5) Implementation Feasibility
- Reference docs:
  - docs/axiom-hive-comet-app-explained.md
  - docs/sovereign-agent-runtime-spec-jarvas-0.md
- Contents:
  - Deterministic Envelopes, State Space Models, Unclaimable Substrate Axioms
  - Gate mechanism APIs and state-transition diagrams
- Auditor task:
  - Confirm Gate feasibly enforces SSOT at runtime.

(6) Ecosystem Correlation
- Reference doc:
  - docs/analysis-of-the-axiom-hive-ecosystem.md
- Contents:
  - Axiom Hive envelope ↔ DetEnforce proxy (policy enforcement)
  - AILock (provenance and tamper-evidence)
- Auditor task:
  - Map components to security posture and operational controls.

(7) Strategic Alignment
- Reference docs:
  - docs/sigma-leverage-manifesto.md
  - docs/axiom-hive-pilot-deployment.md
- Contents:
  - Industry Comparisons, Risk Mathematics vs critiques of Grok and stochastic liability
- Auditor task:
  - Verify consistency with public narrative and risk equations.

Pass Criteria
- All references resolvable via web/ and workspace/ anchors
- Definitions consistent word-for-word
- Proofs complete and correctly reference acceptance predicate
- Implementation sections include API specs and invariants
- Ecosystem mapping is concrete and traceable
