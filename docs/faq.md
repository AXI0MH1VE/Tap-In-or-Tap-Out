AXIOM HIVE — FAQ — C=0

Q: Is C=0 realistic in open-world settings?
A: Scope is governed by SSOT. Unknowns return "undetermined." Acceptance requires proofs.

Q: Performance overhead?
A: Cost of Truth = t_proof / t_inf. Overhead is explicit and justified.

Q: Do updates break prior truths?
A: No. Version tagging preserves legacy validity; new constraints govern future acceptance.

Q: Can competitors adopt the terminology?
A: Terms are trademarked; license mandates attribution; cryptographic signatures prevent legitimate stripping.
