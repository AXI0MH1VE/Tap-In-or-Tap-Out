Abstract
Axiom Hive defines a deterministic acceptance predicate that guarantees Consistency Error Zero (C=0). This document anchors internal drafts and public copies.

Key Definitions (verbatim)
Zero Entropy: The accepted output set has zero uncertainty under SSOT; all accepted outputs are fully determined by axioms and proofs, eliminating probabilistic residuals.
C=0: The count of accepted outputs that fail verification or provenance is zero.
Deterministic Mandate: Verification precedes acceptance; only proofs produce outputs.
